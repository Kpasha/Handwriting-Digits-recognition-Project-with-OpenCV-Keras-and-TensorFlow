linear regression to solve a very different kind of problem: image classification. We begin by installing and importing tensorflow. tensorflow contains some utilities for working with image data. It also provides helper classes to download and import popular datasets like MNIST automatically  In this post you discovered the importance of having a robust way to estimate the performance of your deep learning models on unseen data.  discovered three ways that you can estimate the performance of your deep learning models in Python using the Keras library:
